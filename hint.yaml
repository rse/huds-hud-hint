        <b>ATTENTION</b>: This training is live-streamed with
        unidirectional <i>high-quality</i> video and audio over the
        CIT network via RTMP. What you are currently on is just the
        companion bidirectional <i>low-quality</i> channel of your
        <i>Microsoft Teams</i> client.
        <p/>
        Please stay here for the companion audio conference,
        but install the free <i>VLC Media Player</i> from
        <b>https://www.videolan.org/vlc/</b> and use its "<i>Media
        &rarr; Open Network Stream</i>" or <kbd>CTRL-N</kbd> to also
        open the high-quality live-stream for the trainer from one of
        the following URLs while you are connected to the CIT network
        (either locally or remotely via VPN):
        <p/>
        <blockquote>
            <table>
                <tr><td class="accent"><b>rtmp://proxy.xt.msg.team/stream/engelschall     </b></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1080p: 1920x1080px)</td></tr>
                <tr><td class="accent"><b>rtmp://proxy.xt.msg.team/stream/engelschall-720p</b></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;(720p: 1280x720px)</td></tr>
                <tr><td class="accent"><b>rtmp://proxy.xt.msg.team/stream/engelschall-480p</b></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;(480p: 856x480px)</td></tr>
            </table>
        </blockquote>
        <p/>
        <b>HINT:</b> For best quality choose the <b>1080p</b> stream. In
        case your network bandwidth is very low and you experience frame
        drops, step down to either the (still acceptable) <b>720p</b>
        stream or even the (noticable worse) <b>480p</b> stream.
        <p/>
        <b>NOTICE:</b> the trainer will <i>exclusively</i> speak over
        the undirectional high-quality live-stream, but you should
        stay here in parallel to speak to him and the other attendees
        through this companion audio conference. Keep in mind that
        the high-quality live-stream has a usual latency between 3-4
        seconds, so expect a noticable delay in the trainers response.
        <p/>
        <b>NOTICE:</b> the high-quality live-stream and the companion
        audio-conference of this training is live-mixed and recorded
        by the trainer to provide recap material to all attendees
        afterwards. If you do not want to be recorded, please just
        listen and do not speak on the audio conference.
