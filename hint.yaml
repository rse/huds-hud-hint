        <b>ATTENTION</b>: This training is live-streamed with high-quality video and audio over RTMP.
        What you are currently seeing is just the low-quality live-preview in your <i>Zoom</i> or <i>Teams</i> client.<br/>
        <p/>
        Please install the free <i>VLC Media Player</i> from <b>https://www.videolan.org/vlc/</b>
        and use its "<i>Media &rarr; Open Network Stream</i>" or <kbd>CTRL-N</kbd>
        to open the high-quality live-stream from one of the following URLs:
        <p/>
        <blockquote>
            <table>
                <tr><td><b>rtmp://proxy.xt.msg.team/stream/engelschall</b></td><td>&nbsp;(1080p: 1920x1080px)</td></tr>
                <tr><td><b>rtmp://proxy.xt.msg.team/stream/engelschall-720p</b></td><td>&nbsp;(720p: 1280x720px)</td></tr>
                <tr><td><b>rtmp://proxy.xt.msg.team/stream/engelschall-480p</b></td><td>&nbsp;(480p: 856x480px)</td></tr>
            </table>
        </blockquote>
        <p/>
        <b>HINT:</b> For best quality choose the 1080p stream. In case your network bandwidth
        is low, step down to either the (still acceptable) 720p stream or even the (noticable
        worse) 480p stream.
        <p/>
        <b>NOTICE:</b> the trainer will exclusively speak over the
        undirectional high-quality live-stream channel, but you should
        stay here in parallel to speak to him and the other attendees
        through this bidirectional low-quality live-stream channel. Keep
        in mind that the high-quality live-stream has a usual latency
        between 3-4 seconds, so, when you speak to the trainer, please
        be patient.
